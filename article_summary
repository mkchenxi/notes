Could you show me how the proposed neural network create embeddings based on purchase histories, purchase frequencies and coupons? 

ChatGPT
The proposed neural network in the article by Gabel and Timoshenko creates embeddings for **purchase histories**, **purchase frequencies**, and **coupons** using bottleneck layers. These layers are designed to capture relationships between products, enabling the network to infer both **own-product** and **cross-product** effects from raw transaction data.

Here’s a simplified explanation of how each component is processed:

### 1. **Purchase History Embeddings**
   The purchase history $ B_T $ is a sparse binary vector that records whether a customer has purchased each product over a specific time window (length $ T $).

   - **Time-series filters** are applied to summarize this sparse purchase data. These filters automatically adjust for different interpurchase times between products (e.g., milk is purchased more frequently than detergent). The output is a dense summary, $ B_H $, of the customer’s recent purchases.
   - Bottleneck layers $ W_H $ are then applied to the transformed purchase histories, reducing the dimensionality and generating low-dimensional embeddings for each product based on its purchase history. This helps capture how recent purchases influence future buying behavior.

   The transformation can be represented as:
   $$
   B_H = \sigma(B_T \cdot w_1), \ldots, \sigma(B_T \cdot w_H)
   $$
   where $ w_h $ are the time filters and $ \sigma $ is a non-linear activation function (e.g., leaky ReLU).

   After summarizing the histories, a bottleneck layer further reduces the data dimensionality:
   $$
   E_H = W_{In}^{H} \cdot B_H \quad \text{and} \quad \overline{B}_H = W_{Out}^{H} \cdot E_H
   $$
   where $ W_{In}^{H} $ and $ W_{Out}^{H} $ are weight matrices that learn embeddings for products from the purchase histories.

### 2. **Purchase Frequency Embeddings**
   Purchase frequencies $ B_{\infty} $ provide long-term historical data on how often a customer buys each product.

   - Similar to the treatment of purchase history, the bottleneck layer for purchase frequencies reduces this vector’s dimensionality.
   - The process involves projecting the high-dimensional product-specific frequency vector $ B_{\infty} $ into a lower-dimensional embedding space:
     $$
     E_{\infty} = W_{In}^{\infty} \cdot B_{\infty} \quad \text{and} \quad \overline{B}_{\infty} = W_{Out}^{\infty} \cdot E_{\infty}
     $$

### 3. **Coupon Embeddings**
   Coupons are represented as a vector $ D $ where each element $ d_{ij} $ indicates the discount received by customer $ i $ for product $ j $.

   - Bottleneck layers transform the coupon data into embeddings, capturing relationships between coupon effects on different products. For example, a coupon for Coke might reduce the probability of purchasing Pepsi (cross-product effect), which the bottleneck layer helps capture.
   - The transformation for the coupon vector is similar to the purchase history:
     $$
     E_D = W_{In}^{D} \cdot D \quad \text{and} \quad \overline{D} = W_{Out}^{D} \cdot E_D
     $$
   These embeddings summarize own- and cross-product coupon effects efficiently.

### Combining Embeddings:
   After these transformations, the **purchase history embeddings**, **purchase frequency embeddings**, and **coupon embeddings** are combined into a final feature map $ z $ for each product:
   $$
   z_{i,t+1,j} = [1, D, \overline{D}, B_{\infty}, \overline{B}_{\infty}, B_H, \overline{B}_H]
   $$
   This feature map is then passed through a sigmoid layer to predict the probability that customer $ i $ will purchase product $ j $ at time $ t+1 $:
   $$
   p_{i,t+1,j} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\theta_p \cdot z_{i,t+1,j})}
   $$
   where $ \theta_p $ are the parameters of the sigmoid layer.

This structure enables the network to model complex relationships between different products and their purchase probabilities in response to marketing actions like coupons. The use of bottleneck layers helps create efficient, dense representations (embeddings) that capture customer behavior and product interactions across large assortments.

What is the general explanations of bottleneck layers in neural nets? 

ChatGPT
In neural networks, **bottleneck layers** are used to compress information by reducing the dimensionality of data as it flows through the network. This layer typically has fewer neurons (nodes) than the layers before or after it, forcing the network to learn a more compact and abstract representation of the input. Here’s a general explanation of bottleneck layers:

### Key Concepts of Bottleneck Layers

1. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Bottleneck layers reduce the number of features (dimensionality) passing through the network. For example, if the input layer has 1,000 features, a bottleneck layer might reduce this to 100 or fewer.
   - This forces the network to compress the input data into a more concise form, filtering out less important information while retaining key patterns.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Because the bottleneck layer condenses the data, the neural network is compelled to extract the most relevant features and encode important relationships. This compact representation often highlights hidden patterns that the network has learned from the data.
   - Bottleneck layers are useful in **autoencoders** (where the goal is to encode input data into a smaller latent space) or **deep learning architectures** to make models more efficient.

3. **Regularization**:
   - Reducing the dimensionality through bottleneck layers also acts as a form of **regularization**. By constraining the network’s capacity, the model is less likely to memorize the training data and overfit. Instead, it must generalize by capturing only the most significant information.
   
4. **Information Bottleneck**:
   - The bottleneck can be thought of as a narrow passage through which information must flow. Only essential information can pass, and irrelevant details are filtered out. This compression makes the network more robust and ensures that important patterns are preserved.

5. **Used for Cross-Product Relationships**:
   - In models dealing with complex data relationships (like the one in the article you’re referring to), bottleneck layers help capture shared patterns across different inputs. For example, in retail analytics, a bottleneck layer might capture how products are related to each other by forcing the network to compress many product-specific transformations into a lower-dimensional space, thereby encoding shared characteristics between products.

### Applications of Bottleneck Layers

- **Autoencoders**: In autoencoders, bottleneck layers are used to learn compressed representations of input data. The bottleneck layer sits between the encoder and decoder, compressing the input into a lower-dimensional latent space.
  
- **Transfer Learning**: Pretrained networks often use bottleneck layers to extract compressed, high-level features that can be transferred and reused in other tasks. This is common in image classification tasks where a model trained on one dataset can be adapted to another using its bottleneck representations.

- **Reducing Model Complexity**: In complex models with large amounts of data, bottleneck layers help reduce computational overhead by compressing information before performing further operations. This enables models to scale efficiently without requiring vast amounts of memory or processing power.

### Example of a Bottleneck Layer in Action
Imagine a neural network for image classification. The input layer has 10,000 pixels (features). A bottleneck layer might reduce this to just 100 neurons, forcing the network to learn only the most critical visual features (such as edges, textures, or patterns) from the image. This compressed information is then passed to further layers for classification, ensuring the network focuses on meaningful patterns rather than noise or redundant information.

### In the Context of the Article
In the research paper you are reading, bottleneck layers are used to create **dense product representations** from purchase history and coupon data. This compact representation allows the network to capture **cross-product relationships** more efficiently. Instead of treating each product independently, the bottleneck layer helps the network generalize how products are related (for example, similar products in the same category), improving predictions without needing to explicitly define these relationships beforehand.

How do the time filters work for the purchase histories to get the bottleneck layer B^H? Could you explain to me with an example? 

ChatGPT
The time filters used in the paper help process **purchase histories** to create **dense summaries** that can be passed through the **bottleneck layer** $B^H$. These time filters act as a form of **automatic feature extraction**, specifically designed to handle the sparsity and irregularity in purchase data (i.e., the fact that customers buy products at irregular intervals).

### How Time Filters Work in the Model:

1. **Purchase History Data $ B_T $**:
   - For each product, the purchase history $ B_T $ is a binary matrix of size $ J \times T $, where:
     - $ J $ is the number of products, and
     - $ T $ is the length of the time window (e.g., 30 days or 10 weeks).
   - Each element $ b_{it} $ in this matrix is 1 if customer $ i $ purchased product $ j $ at time $ t $, and 0 otherwise.

2. **Time-Series Filters $ w_h $**:
   - The network applies multiple **time-series filters** $ w_h $ (each filter is a vector of length $ T $) to summarize the purchase histories into meaningful features. These filters are learned automatically during training.
   - Each filter $ w_h $ transforms the purchase history vector of each product $ B_T $ by taking a weighted combination of past purchases over time, making it possible to summarize purchase dynamics.
   - **Leaky ReLU activation** is applied to allow the network to handle both positive and negative signals, improving flexibility.

3. **Applying Time Filters to Purchase Histories**:
   - The model applies $ H $ different filters $ w_1, w_2, ..., w_H $ to the purchase history $ B_T $, where $ H $ is the number of time filters. Each filter detects different types of purchase patterns (e.g., frequent or infrequent purchases).
   - The purchase history matrix $ B_T $ is multiplied by each filter $ w_h $, and the results are passed through a **leaky ReLU** activation function. This yields a transformed purchase history matrix $ B_H $ of size $ J \times H $.

   Mathematically, this operation looks like:
   $$
   B_H = \left[\sigma(B_T \cdot w_1), \sigma(B_T \cdot w_2), \dots, \sigma(B_T \cdot w_H)\right]
   $$
   where:
   - $ B_T $ is the original purchase history for customer $ i $,
   - $ w_h $ is one of the time-series filters (vectors),
   - $ \sigma(x) $ is the **leaky ReLU** activation function, defined as:
     $$
     \sigma(x) = 
     \begin{cases}
       x & \text{if } x \geq 0, \\
       0.2x & \text{if } x < 0.
     \end{cases}
     $$
   
### Example to Illustrate Time Filters

Let's consider an example with a simplified setup:

- **Customer**: Customer $ i $ buys **milk** at irregular intervals over the past 5 weeks.
- **Time window $ T = 5 $**: We have purchase history for the last 5 weeks.
- **Purchase History Matrix $ B_T $** for **milk**:
  $$
  B_T = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
  $$
  This means the customer bought milk in weeks 2 and 5.

- Now, we apply **two time filters** $ w_1 $ and $ w_2 $ (in this case, $ H = 2 $) to this purchase history.

  Let's assume the filters are:
  $$
  w_1 = [0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1], \quad w_2 = [0.5, 0.25, 0.15, 0.05, 0.05]
  $$

- **Applying Filter 1 $ w_1 $**:
  Multiply each element of the filter $ w_1 $ by the corresponding element of the purchase history vector $ B_T $ (i.e., take a weighted average of recent purchases):
  $$
  B_T \cdot w_1 = (0 \times 0.1) + (1 \times 0.2) + (0 \times 0.4) + (0 \times 0.2) + (1 \times 0.1) = 0.2 + 0.1 = 0.3
  $$

- **Applying Filter 2 $ w_2 $**:
  Similarly, for the second filter:
  $$
  B_T \cdot w_2 = (0 \times 0.5) + (1 \times 0.25) + (0 \times 0.15) + (0 \times 0.05) + (1 \times 0.05) = 0.25 + 0.05 = 0.3
  $$

- **Leaky ReLU Activation**:
  Now, the network applies **Leaky ReLU** activation to both results. Since both results are positive, the activation function does not modify the values.
  So:
  $$
  \sigma(0.3) = 0.3
  $$
  for both filters.

- **Dense Summary $ B_H $**:
  The final result is a dense summary of the purchase history for milk, represented by:
  $$
  B_H = [0.3, 0.3]
  $$
  This vector represents the transformed purchase history for milk, with both filters summarizing different patterns.

### Bottleneck Layer $ B^H $:
After applying the time filters, the network applies a **bottleneck layer** to further reduce the dimensionality of the purchase history summary $ B_H $.

The bottleneck transformation looks like this:
$$
E_H = W_{In}^H \cdot B_H \quad \text{and} \quad \overline{B}_H = W_{Out}^H \cdot E_H
$$
where $ W_{In}^H $ and $ W_{Out}^H $ are weight matrices that are learned during training. This final step creates **low-dimensional embeddings** for each product's purchase history, which will be combined with other features (e.g., coupon embeddings) to predict future purchases.

### Summary:
- **Time filters** summarize irregular purchase patterns by applying weighted combinations of purchase histories (like weighted averages).
- These summaries are passed through a **Leaky ReLU** function and compressed by a **bottleneck layer** to create efficient **embeddings**.
- These embeddings represent important information about the timing of past purchases and how they influence future buying decisions. 

This allows the model to handle different interpurchase times across products and create personalized predictions.

In the simulations Section 4, how do the authors simulate the cross-product relationships?  

ChatGPT
In **Section 4** of the paper, the authors simulate **cross-product relationships** as part of a two-stage process for **customer purchase behavior**. This simulation is designed to mimic how customers decide which categories and products to buy, and how **coupons** or **inventory levels** affect these decisions across different products and categories. 

Here’s a breakdown of how they simulate **cross-product relationships**:

### 1. **Two-Stage Purchase Decision Process**

The authors simulate the purchase decision in two stages:

- **Stage 1: Category Purchase Incidence**
  - In this stage, a customer decides whether to buy a product from a **specific category**. This is modeled as a **multivariate probit** process, where the customer’s decision is based on:
    - **Customer preferences** for the category,
    - **Coupon discounts** offered for products in the category,
    - **Cross-category coupon effects**, i.e., how discounts in one category affect the likelihood of purchasing from other categories,
    - **Inventory** levels, which reduce the likelihood of purchasing from a category if the customer recently bought a product in that category.

  Mathematically, the **utility** of purchasing from a category $ c $ is modeled as:
  $$
  u_{itc} = \gamma_c + \gamma_{ic} + \gamma_{p_{ic}} \cdot \bar{d}_{itc} + \sum_{k \neq c} \gamma_{p_{ick}} \cdot \bar{d}_{itk} + \gamma_{Inv_{ic}} \cdot Inv_{tic} + \epsilon_{itc}
  $$
  - **Cross-category effects** are simulated through the term $ \sum_{k \neq c} \gamma_{p_{ick}} \cdot \bar{d}_{itk} $, which captures how coupon discounts for other categories $ k $ influence the decision to purchase from category $ c $. These cross-category coupon effects can either increase or decrease the probability of purchasing from a related category.
  - **Inventory dynamics** are included, where high inventory in a category reduces the probability of buying from that category in future time periods.

- **Stage 2: Product Choice within the Category**
  - Once the customer decides to purchase from a category, they then choose a specific product within that category.
  - This stage is modeled using a **multinomial logit** model, where the utility for choosing a product $ j $ within a category $ c $ is influenced by:
    - **Base utility** for the product (which varies across customers),
    - **Price sensitivity** (higher discounts increase the probability of purchasing),
    - **Cross-product coupon effects** within the same category (e.g., a discount on Coke might reduce the likelihood of buying Pepsi).

  The utility for product $ j $ in category $ c $ is modeled as:
  $$
  u_{itj} = \beta_{0ij} - \beta_{p_i} \cdot (1 - d_{itj}) \cdot \text{price}_j + \epsilon_{itj}
  $$
  - The model captures how coupon discounts for a product affect both the **own-product purchase probability** and **cross-product effects** (e.g., how a Coke discount affects the likelihood of buying other soft drinks like Pepsi).

### 2. **Cross-Product Coupon Effects**
The authors explicitly model cross-product relationships through **coupon effects** in both stages of the decision process:

- **Within-Category Cross-Product Effects**: 
  - A coupon for one product in a category (e.g., Coke) reduces the likelihood of buying other products in the same category (e.g., Pepsi) by increasing the probability of choosing the discounted product.
  - This is captured in the **multinomial logit model** in Stage 2, where each product's purchase probability is adjusted by the coupon discount of competing products within the same category.

- **Cross-Category Coupon Effects**: 
  - Coupons for products in one category can influence the likelihood of purchasing products from related categories. For instance, a discount on a soft drink could increase the probability of purchasing complementary items like snacks (positive cross-category effects), or it could decrease the likelihood of purchasing items from unrelated categories (negative cross-category effects).
  - These relationships are included in the **multivariate probit model** in Stage 1 through the cross-category terms $ \gamma_{p_{ick}} $, which simulate how discounts in one category affect the purchase likelihood in another.

### 3. **Customer Heterogeneity and Preferences**
The model also incorporates **customer heterogeneity** by simulating customer-specific preferences and price sensitivities. The cross-product relationships are not uniform across all customers but depend on each customer’s latent preferences (modeled by latent factors $ \Theta_i $).

For instance:
- Some customers may prefer both Coke and Pepsi, so a discount on Coke might significantly reduce the probability of buying Pepsi (strong cross-product substitution effect).
- Other customers might be loyal to a single brand, meaning that cross-product effects are minimal for them.

### 4. **Simulating Coupon Assignments and Cross-Product Relationships**
Coupons are assigned randomly to customers in each period, with discounts ranging from 10% to 40%. The model simulates how these **random coupon assignments** affect both own-product and cross-product purchase probabilities, helping to evaluate the predictive performance of the proposed neural network model.

### Summary of Simulated Cross-Product Relationships:
- **Within-Category Cross-Product Effects**: Discounts on one product affect the purchase probabilities of other products within the same category (e.g., Coke vs. Pepsi).
- **Cross-Category Effects**: Discounts in one category can influence purchases in related categories (e.g., soft drinks affecting snack purchases).
- **Customer Preferences**: The cross-product relationships vary across customers based on their preferences and sensitivities to discounts.

These simulated relationships are used to evaluate the model’s ability to capture complex cross-product effects in retail data. The proposed neural network architecture, with its bottleneck layers, aims to learn these relationships automatically from transaction data.

For the Within-Category Cross-Product Effects, I'm not sure the utility function has that term. uitj​=β0ij​−βpi​​⋅(1−ditj​)⋅pricej​+ϵitj​ 

ChatGPT
You're right to point out that the utility function in **Stage 2** of the simulation setup:

$$
u_{itj} = \beta_{0ij} - \beta_{p_i} \cdot (1 - d_{itj}) \cdot \text{price}_j + \epsilon_{itj}
$$

does not explicitly include terms that directly model **within-category cross-product effects**. The term only captures the **own-product utility** — i.e., how discounts and price sensitivity affect the likelihood of purchasing a particular product $ j $.

Let's break this down more clearly:

### 1. **Own-Product Utility** (No Cross-Product Effect in Formula)
In this utility function, the components are:
- $ \beta_{0ij} $: This is the base utility of product $ j $ for customer $ i $, which reflects their general preference for that product.
- $ \beta_{p_i} $: Customer $ i $'s price sensitivity. This term reflects how much the customer responds to price discounts.
- $ d_{itj} $: The discount offered for product $ j $ at time $ t $ for customer $ i $. 
  - $ (1 - d_{itj}) \cdot \text{price}_j $ captures the discounted price for product $ j $, where $ d_{itj} $ is a proportion (e.g., 0.30 for a 30% discount).
- $ \epsilon_{itj} $: The random error term, which reflects unobserved factors that influence customer $ i $'s decision to purchase product $ j $.

This utility function models how **own-product factors** (price, discount, and baseline preference) affect the purchase likelihood. It doesn't directly include **cross-product** effects.

### 2. **Implicit Modeling of Within-Category Cross-Product Effects**
Even though the utility function doesn't explicitly include cross-product terms, **within-category cross-product effects** can still emerge **implicitly** through the **multinomial logit model** structure:

- **Multinomial Logit (MNL) Model**: The customer makes a decision among all products within the chosen category. In a multinomial logit model, the probability that a customer chooses product $ j $ in a category $ c $ is:
  $$
  P(bitj = 1 | y_{itc} = 1) = \frac{\exp(u_{itj})}{\sum_{k \in C} \exp(u_{itk})}
  $$
  where $ C $ is the set of all products in the chosen category.
  
  This structure means that **all products within a category are competing** for the customer’s attention. If the utility for product $ j $ increases due to a coupon discount, the **probability of choosing other products in the same category decreases**.

  **Effectively**, this leads to **within-category cross-product effects**, because an increase in the utility of one product (due to a discount, for example) reduces the likelihood of purchasing other products in the same category.

### 3. **How the Cross-Product Effect Happens**
For example, consider a customer choosing between **Coke** and **Pepsi** in the same category:
- If a coupon for **Coke** is applied, the utility of Coke increases. 
- In a **multinomial logit model**, this increase in Coke's utility decreases the probability of choosing **Pepsi** (since the sum of probabilities across all products in the category must equal 1).

This competitive structure ensures that **within-category cross-product effects** emerge naturally from the model, even though they aren't explicitly encoded in the utility function.

### Summary
The utility function $ u_{itj} $ in **Stage 2** does not explicitly model cross-product effects within a category. However, the **multinomial logit model** framework inherently captures these effects due to the competition between products within the same category. When one product's utility increases (e.g., due to a discount), it reduces the likelihood of choosing other products in the same category, thus creating **within-category cross-product effects** indirectly.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification or more examples!

I'm not sure about the authors' model choice here, as the multinomial logit model suffers from Independent Irrelevant Alternatives problem. Would a probit model be better? 

ChatGPT
You're correct in noting that the **multinomial logit model (MNL)** suffers from the **independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA)** problem. This assumption implies that the relative odds of choosing between any two products are unaffected by the presence or characteristics of other products, which can be unrealistic in many real-world settings, especially for **within-category** choices where products can be close substitutes (e.g., Coke and Pepsi).

Let's explore this in more detail and discuss whether a **probit model** might be a better choice in the authors' setup.

### 1. **The IIA Problem in Multinomial Logit (MNL)**
The IIA assumption can lead to **unrealistic substitution patterns** in some scenarios. For example, if a new product similar to Coke (e.g., Diet Coke) is introduced, the MNL model would predict that the introduction of Diet Coke would reduce the probability of choosing **all other products** in the category equally, including products like **detergent** or **bread**. In reality, customers are more likely to switch from Coke to Diet Coke (rather than switching to detergent), which the MNL model may not properly capture due to the IIA constraint.

This is a known issue when:
- Products are **close substitutes** (e.g., Coke and Pepsi),
- Substitution patterns are more complex than MNL assumes,
- Cross-product relationships are crucial, as in the case of **within-category cross-product effects** discussed earlier.

### 2. **Why a Probit Model Could Be Better**
A **multivariate probit model** might be a better alternative in this case because it allows for **correlated errors** between products. This relaxes the IIA assumption and can capture more realistic substitution patterns, especially for products within the same category.

- In a **probit model**, the choices are based on latent utilities, and the errors (unobserved factors influencing choice) are allowed to be **correlated**.
- This means that if Coke and Pepsi are close substitutes, their error terms could be highly correlated, leading to more realistic substitution patterns.
  
  Mathematically, in a **multivariate probit**:
  $$
  U_{ij} = X_{ij} \beta + \epsilon_{ij}, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)
  $$
  where $ \Sigma $ is a covariance matrix that allows for correlated errors across products $ j $.

This would allow the model to account for the fact that, for example, a coupon on **Coke** would mostly affect the probability of purchasing **Pepsi** (as they are substitutes), rather than affecting the likelihood of purchasing unrelated products like **detergent**.

### 3. **Advantages of the Probit Model Over MNL**
- **More Realistic Substitution Patterns**: By allowing for correlated errors between products, the probit model can better capture **within-category cross-product effects**, where the substitution between similar products (Coke vs. Pepsi) is stronger than substitution between dissimilar products (Coke vs. detergent).
  
- **No IIA Restriction**: Unlike MNL, the probit model doesn’t assume that the odds of choosing between any two products are independent of other products. This can provide more accurate predictions in cases where product similarity matters.

- **Flexibility with Cross-Category Effects**: The probit model can also handle **cross-category effects** more naturally by allowing the covariance structure to reflect relationships between different product categories (e.g., snacks and soft drinks).

### 4. **Why the Authors Might Have Chosen MNL**
Despite the advantages of the probit model, there are a few reasons why the authors might have chosen MNL in their model:

- **Scalability**: MNL is computationally simpler and more scalable, especially when dealing with large numbers of products and customers, as in the case of retail datasets with many SKUs.
  
- **Implementation Efficiency**: MNL models are widely implemented and easier to fit, especially when compared to the **multivariate probit model**, which requires the estimation of a covariance matrix. This makes MNL models attractive for large-scale retail applications, where computational efficiency is important.

- **Performance Gains from Neural Network Architecture**: In this particular paper, the authors use a **neural network architecture** that incorporates **bottleneck layers** and other transformations to **implicitly model cross-product relationships**. The neural network can compensate for some of the limitations of MNL by learning patterns from data, potentially making the IIA problem less significant in practice.

### 5. **Could Probit Be Better in This Context?**
In theory, yes—**a multivariate probit model** would be better suited to modeling complex substitution patterns and cross-product effects, especially when products are close substitutes within the same category. However, the trade-off would be in terms of **computational cost and scalability**.

- The authors' choice of MNL is likely a **pragmatic decision** based on the need to handle large-scale datasets, where **deep learning** components (like bottleneck layers) help mitigate the limitations of MNL.
  
- If the problem of **within-category substitution** is critical, a **multivariate probit** might indeed perform better. However, it could be more computationally demanding, especially when scaling to large assortments and customer bases.

### Summary
- **Multinomial logit (MNL)** is computationally efficient but suffers from the **IIA problem**, which can lead to unrealistic substitution patterns, especially in categories with close substitutes.
- A **multivariate probit** model would allow for more realistic substitution patterns by allowing **correlated errors** across products, but it would be more complex and computationally expensive.
- The authors likely chose MNL for its scalability and simplicity, and they used a **deep learning framework** (with bottleneck layers) to help compensate for some of the limitations of MNL, making it a practical choice for large-scale retail datasets.
  
In practice, if computational resources allow, a **probit model** would provide more realistic modeling of cross-product relationships, especially within categories.
